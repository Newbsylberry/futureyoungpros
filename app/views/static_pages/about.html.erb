    <p> The Future 40 Below-ers program gives students the opportunity to spend a day (or half-day) with a local young 
	professional in various career fields.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This opportunity allows students to explore and actually experience a snapshot of what a day in a 
	particular career field entails.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>Students are encouraged to participate more than once - shadow as many professionals as it takes to find out 
    what you truly want to do for a living!</p>

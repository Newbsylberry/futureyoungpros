      <p> The Future 40 Below-ers program gives students the opportunity to spend a day (or half-day) with a local young 
	professional in various career fields. This opportunity allows you to explore and actually experience a snapshot of what a day in a particular career field entails. Students are 
	encouraged to participate more than once - shadow as many professionals as it takes to find out what you truly want to do for a living!</p>
